								<b>What's the Issue?</b> </br>
								• While various policy interventions and technical developments have advances the practices and impact
								of digital stewardship, sustainability continues to be a systemic problem for digital scholarship. 
								<br>
								• The least tractable challenge to sustaining digital schoalrship continues to be the most essential: 
								many digital humanities resources and digital community archives resist institutional collection due 
								to the depth of ongoing investment and control that communities wish to retain over the resources
								they have created.
								</br>
								<b>Why?</b> </br>
								• Outside of exceptionally well-resourced digital humanities centers and libraries, 
								community-driven digital collections and databases lack systemic support. Digital humanities collections 
								and digital community archives tend to be created and maintained by small, collaborative teams of community members, 
								researchers, and technologists, often without ongoing assistance from curation institutions. </br>
								• The prevailing paradigm—of library, museum, or archive stewardship of digital collections—struggles to 
								accommodate the diversity, complexity, and community-centeredness of digital humanities scholarship and 
								digital community archives.

								<!-- 	A <br> tag puts in a break so that the text that follows it displays on
									the next line.
								-->
								<b>Conduct Compratative Case Studies to:</b><br>
								• Produce and evaaluate a preliminary framework of community-centered sustainability strategies <br>
								• Understand how collections and communities mutually contribute to one another's long-term sustainability <br>
								• Articulate sustainability requirements for diverse projects in a range of contexts <br>
								• Identify contextual factors that affect sustainability of collections and other resources <br>
								• Choose and implement stragies to increase sustainability of digital collection
				
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Investigate Sociotechnical Workflows to:</b><br>
								• Identify how workflows facilitate or compromise ongoing collection development and maintenance, and ultiamte durability <br>
								• Identify how these workflows can effectively center collection constituencies <br>
								• Refine models for equitable partnership among cultural institutions and communities <br>
								• Identify roles that cultural instiutions may play to support community-determined and community-led sustainability strategies
